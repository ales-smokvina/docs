## Whitelist IP Addresses

When using [Custom Database Connections](/connections/database/custom-db), [Rules](/rules), and [Hooks](/hooks), you will want to whitelist inbound and outbound Auth0 IP addresses to ensure proper functionality.

Please refer to the Management Dashboard for the region-specific set of IP addresses you should whitelist.

To see the specific set of IP addresses that you need to whitelist, you can check the Dashboard. The full list is provided when you create your new [Custom Database Connection](${manage_url}/#/connections/database), [Hook](${manage_url}/#/hooks), or [Rule](${manage_url}/#/rules/create).
